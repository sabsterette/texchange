Status of Bugs/Known Omissions
Currently, the only bug that exists is that the CSS for the front-end renders differently on different devices. There are also some omissions that we did not have the time to tackle. There is no reset password function as of this version. And although there is a help button on the navigation bar under settings, this page does not lead anywhere because it has not been created. It was our intention to finish the user guide first and then create this page because it will be mostly the same information. Another small feature that has not been sorted is the price validation. To create a textbook listing, one must input the price. Right now, we have it so that this price field must be filled out, so the form will generate an error if this is not the case. However, we have not figured out how to distinguish a type error. Specifically, if a user inputs a string instead of an integer value, then the error generated says “This field is required” instead of that an integer is required.
