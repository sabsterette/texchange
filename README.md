How to Run the Application

It is suggested to run the application on Firefox Web Browser. *ADD MORE*


Create an Account

After opening Firefox, the landing page is the login. First, you must create an account. Enter your username, email, and password. Once your account is created, you will be redirected to the login page.


Logging In

You can login with your username and password account credentials.


Home Page

Upon logging in, you will be taken to the home page. On this page, you will see all textbook listings that you have created. There will also be an option to create a textbook listing.


Create Textbook Listing

You can create a textbook listing from the link on the home page. To create a listing, you must provide the title, author, price, class, and condition of the textbook. The edition and description are optional. Once a textbook is created, you will see it listed on your homepage as well as in the search page.


Editing a Textbook Listing

Upon creating a textbook listing, if you decide that you want to edit the details, you can click on "view more info" at the bottom of the textbook listing. This will take you to a separate page, where you can only edit your listings. Once editing the list, you can update it and the new information will be stored.


Deleting a Textbook Listing

Once you are on the edit page for a textbook, you also have the option to delete it. If you click this button, a confirmation box will pop up. If you are confident in your decision, you can confirm and delete the listing.


Navigation Bar

The navigation bar is present on every page except for the login and registration pages. Starting from the lefthand side, the Texchange logo (stack of books) returns you to your homepage. The magnifying glass image directs you to the search page. On the righthand side, the settings image is a dropdown list that can direct you to your profile, a help page, or allow you to logout of your account.


Searching for a Textbook

Once directed to the search page, you can see all the textbook listings from users in your database, including your own listings. There are various filters that you can use to narrow your search by title and author. You can also sort listings by price, class, condition, date posted, and edition. You can click on "view more info" to see the details of any textbook listing. 


Requesting a Listing

If you decide you would like to buy a textbook, you can click on "view more info" to see the details of the listing. Here, you can click the link to request more information from the poster. This link will send an email notification to the poster, who will receive your email and profile link. That person will then reach out to you to negotiate the details of the transaction.


Viewing Profiles of Other Users

If you click "view more info" at the bottom of any textbook listing, it will take you to a page with all the details of the textbook as well as the username of the poster. You can click on this username to be taken to the profile of this poster.


Leaving Reviews

If you are on the profile of another user, you can choose to leave a review. For a review, you must provide a rating (on a scale of 1-5) and a description. You can choose to display your username with the review or keep it anonymous. 


Editing Your Profile

You can find your profile from the navigation bar, by clicking on the settings image and then "Profile." You can edit your username, email, and add a bio here. You can also see your reviews on your profile page. 


Status of Bugs/Known Omissions

Currently, the only bug that exists is that the CSS for the front-end renders differently on different devices. There are also some omissions that we did not have the time to tackle. There is no reset password function as of this version. And although there is a help button on the navigation bar under settings, this page does not lead anywhere because it has not been created. It was our intention to finish the user guide first and then create this page because it will be mostly the same information. Another small feature that has not been sorted is the price validation. To create a textbook listing, one must input the price. Right now, we have it so that this price field must be filled out, so the form will generate an error if this is not the case. However, we have not figured out how to distinguish a type error. Specifically, if a user inputs a string instead of an integer value, then the error generated says “This field is required” instead of that an integer is required.
